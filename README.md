# About -
The Restaurant is heavily inspired by the popular show/manga - **OnePiece** written by **Eiichiro Oda**. This restaurant is located in the middle of the sea providing delicious food for thousands of wanderers passing by. As expected, since this is a sea restaurant, the majority of the dishes are Sea foods. The main motto of our restaurant is to - **Never Waste Food**.
